However, a mischievous gremlin has spirited away the support archive, leaving the wizards without their precious troubleshooting tome. In a pinch, they must now extract the Dynakube configuration directly from the cluster’s ethereal fabric, bypassing the vanished archive and the initial incantations used to summon the DynaMagus.\n\n##### The Dynatrace Operator should already be set up and deployed properly in Cloud Native Full-Stack mode on your test cluster. Run a support archive for the Operator. Save this as a .tgz file.\n##### After you do this, assume that the support archive wasn’t pulled, but you still need to get the Dynakube file for troubleshooting. DO NOT use the YAML file that you applied when setting up the Dynatrace Operator or from the support archive, pull it from the cluster. Show the command you used to pull this file, and save the file as “scenario3-dynakube.yaml”.\n\n### Deliverables:\n* The command(s) you used to pull all of the resources\n* Screenshots of the .tgz file you created (use `ls -l` to see the file, show its file size)\n* A copy of your Dynakube YAML file from the scenario"},{"id":"b3e3d3a2-c91b-4f91-a776-c6e73c237ff3","type":"markdown","markdown":"# Answer\n\nUse this markdown tile to include your answer!
