This project, dubbed “Project Quasar,” operates on cutting-edge algorithms that, due to their unique nature, are not compatible with traditional monitoring tools like Dynatrace. The engineers must deploy a nimble web server using the “nginx:alpine” image in a new Kubernetes namespace, ensuring it remains unmonitored to maintain the integrity of their experimental protocols.\n\n##### Create a new namespace called “scenario1”, that will NOT be deep monitored with Dynatrace monitoring. To ensure that monitoring is not applied to any resources within these pods, create a pod called “nginx” and use the “nginx:alpine” image. Use kubectl and Dynatrace to ensure that no injection has taken place in the pod.\n\n### Helpful links:\n* [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)\n\n### Deliverables:\n* The command you used to create the Nginx pod\n* Screenshots of kubectl showing no injection occurred\n* Screenshots of Dynatrace showing injection has not occurred"},{"id":"b3e3d3a2-c91b-4f91-a776-c6e73c237ff3","type":"markdown","markdown":"# Answer\n\nUse this markdown tile to include your answer!
